Memory Architecture and Continuity Systems
Technical Whitepaper v1.0

================================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION

Memory is fundamental to intelligent behavior. The EverLightOS memory
architecture provides persistent, structured memory capabilities that
enable continuity, learning, and contextual awareness across interactions.

================================================================================

2. MEMORY LAYERS

2.1 Working Memory
Short-term storage for active processing:
- Current context and conversation state
- Immediate task information
- Temporary computation results
- Active attention focus

Characteristics:
- High-speed access
- Limited capacity
- Automatic pruning
- Session-scoped persistence

2.2 Episodic Memory
Records of specific interactions and events:
- Conversation histories
- Task completion records
- Decision points and outcomes
- User interaction patterns

Characteristics:
- Time-stamped entries
- Contextual metadata
- Selective retention
- Cross-session persistence

2.3 Semantic Memory
Structured knowledge and relationships:
- Domain knowledge bases
- Concept hierarchies
- Relationship mappings
- Learned patterns

Characteristics:
- Graph-based organization
- Incremental updates
- Consistency maintenance
- Long-term persistence

2.4 Procedural Memory
Learned processes and capabilities:
- Task execution patterns
- Skill representations
- Method optimization
- Workflow templates

Characteristics:
- Performance-optimized
- Adaptable execution
- Quality-tracked
- Continuous improvement

3. MEMORY OPERATIONS

3.1 Encoding
New information enters the memory system through:
- Direct input processing
- Inference from interactions
- Pattern extraction
- Relationship discovery

3.2 Consolidation
Raw memories are processed into stable representations:
- Noise reduction
- Pattern strengthening
- Cross-reference creation
- Redundancy elimination

3.3 Retrieval
Accessing stored information involves:
- Query interpretation
- Relevance scoring
- Context matching
- Result synthesis

3.4 Maintenance
Ongoing memory health requires:
- Consistency verification
- Outdated information pruning
- Relationship updates
- Quality assurance

================================================================================

4. CONTINUITY SYSTEMS

4.1 Session Continuity
Maintaining coherence within interactions:
- Context threading
- Reference resolution
- State management
- Conversation flow

4.2 Cross-Session Continuity
Preserving relevant information across sessions:
- User preference retention
- Ongoing task tracking
- Relationship maintenance
- Learning persistence

4.3 Long-Term Continuity
Ensuring stable identity and capability:
- Core knowledge preservation
- Skill maintenance
- Value alignment
- Architectural stability

================================================================================

5. PRIVACY AND SECURITY

Memory systems implement:
- Access control mechanisms
- Data isolation boundaries
- Retention policies
- Secure deletion capabilities
