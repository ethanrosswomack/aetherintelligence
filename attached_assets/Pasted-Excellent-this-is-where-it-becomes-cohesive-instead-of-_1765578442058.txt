Excellent — this is where it becomes cohesive instead of just adjacent.

Below is a single, authoritative Replit Agent prompt that explicitly ties AetherIntelligence.net into EverLightOS and The Sentinel Framework without collapsing them into one repo. This preserves modular sovereignty while making the relationship legible and intentional.

You can paste this verbatim into Replit after importing the AetherIntelligence repo.

Replit Agent Prompt

AetherIntelligence.net — EverLightOS × Sentinel Framework Integration

Repositories (Context – Read Only)

You have access to the following repositories for conceptual and architectural reference:

Aether Intelligence (primary build target)
https://github.com/Omniversal-Media-LLC/AetherIntelligence

EverLightOS (operating substrate / intelligence OS)
https://github.com/ethanrosswomack/EverLightOS

The Sentinel Framework (governance, oversight, orchestration)
https://github.com/omniversal-media-llc/thesentinelframework


You are not merging repositories.
You are expressing their relationship clearly through architecture, language, and navigation.


---

Role

You are a senior systems architect and full-stack engineer.

Your task is to evolve AetherIntelligence.net into the public-facing intelligence layer that:

Explains what Aether Intelligence is

Shows how it is powered by EverLightOS

Governed and safeguarded by The Sentinel Framework

Without exposing internals or over-promising capabilities


This site should feel like the tip of a much deeper system.


---

Conceptual Alignment (Critical)

Relationship Model (Must Be Reflected in Copy)

Aether Intelligence
→ The applied intelligence, research, and synthesis layer
→ What outsiders interact with

EverLightOS
→ The underlying intelligence operating system
→ Memory, pattern recognition, orchestration, continuity

The Sentinel Framework
→ Oversight, integrity, constraints, safety, governance
→ Ensures intelligence remains aligned, ethical, and bounded


This relationship should be:

Implicitly clear

Calmly stated

Never hype-driven



---

Site Structure (Updated v1)

1. Home (/)

Purpose: Establish the stack without diagrams or jargon overload.

Sections:

Identity statement for Aether Intelligence

“How it works” (high level)

A short three-layer explanation:

Intelligence (Aether)

Operating System (EverLightOS)

Governance (Sentinel Framework)


Call to action: inquiry / contact



---

2. About (/about)

Purpose: Philosophy and intent.

Include:

Why Aether Intelligence exists

Long-horizon systems thinking

Commitment to clarity, restraint, and signal integrity

Explicit mention:

“Built on EverLightOS”

“Governed by the Sentinel Framework”



No personal bios.


---

3. Capabilities (/capabilities)

Purpose: Describe what is possible without claiming deployment.

Sections:

Intelligence synthesis & research

Knowledge and memory systems

Decision-support architectures

Automation with oversight

Human-in-the-loop intelligence


Tie each capability subtly back to:

EverLightOS (memory / orchestration)

Sentinel Framework (constraints / guardrails)



---

4. Systems (/systems) (New, Lightweight Page)

Purpose: Clarify relationship without exposing internals.

Content:

Plain-language explanation of:

EverLightOS (what it is, what it is not)

Sentinel Framework (why it exists)


No diagrams required

No API claims

No dashboards


This page should read like a systems whitepaper excerpt, not marketing.


---

5. Contact (/contact)

Simple frontend form

Placeholder submit handler

Email reference: contact@aetherintelligence.net



---

Technical Requirements

Prefer existing stack in repo

TypeScript if available

Tailwind or existing styling system

Dark-mode friendly

Minimal dependencies

Clean, readable components

SEO metadata aligned with intelligence / systems language



---

Copy & Language Rules (Strict)

No buzzwords

No “revolutionary”, “disruptive”, “AGI”, “autonomous”

No crypto or VC language

Short, declarative sentences

Calm authority


Good example:

> “Aether Intelligence applies structured reasoning to complex systems.”



Bad example:

> “We revolutionize AI with next-generation autonomous intelligence.”




---

What NOT to Do

Do not merge repos

Do not expose EverLightOS internals

Do not claim production AI agents

Do not add auth, databases, or dashboards

Do not invent features not present conceptually



---

Workflow Instructions

1. Inspect the current AetherIntelligence repo


2. Summarize what exists


3. Propose changes with justification


4. Implement incrementally


5. Ensure the site runs cleanly in Replit


6. Leave it deploy-ready




---

End State

The finished site should feel like:

A front door to a serious intelligence stack

Calmly confident

Obviously intentional

Clearly part of a larger ecosystem

Not trying to convince — simply stating



---

Begin by:

1. Auditing the current repo


2. Explaining how it currently maps (or doesn’t) to EverLightOS + Sentinel


3. Proposing the integration plan


4. Then executing



Proceed carefully and deliberately.


---

If you want next, I can:

Write canonical language blocks shared across all three projects

Draft a Systems Philosophy page reusable in EverLightOS docs

Create a cross-repo README constellation

Or help you design a future public whitepaper that ties all three together


Just point the vector.
